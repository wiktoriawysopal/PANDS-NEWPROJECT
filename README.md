# INSTRUCTIONS:

This repository consist of several files:  
* .gitignore
* LICENSE
* README.md - project documentation
* iris.csv - data set
* iris_code.py - python script
* project.pdf - project description


The data set was downloaded from publicly available source UCI Machine Learning repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris. The data was accessed by following tutorial on the machinelearningmastery website. In this case the data was loaded by using website URL. In the first approach the data was downloaded as a .csv file, which is included in this repository however in the further analysis it caused problems.  
Anyone who wants to use this code should get familair with the dataset and project description available in this repository in the pdf file.  
In order to execute the python program the user should download the dataset and install a python program on the computer. It is recommended to dowload the anaconda version, since it include needed librarries such as PANDAS, NumPy and Matplot.    
The python script is saved in this folder as iris_code.py. It can be run in any terminal such as built-in powershell in visual studio code or commander. User needs to download the file and saved on its own computer. To run the code simply type python iris_code.py in the interpreter and press enter.  


## 1. Background information about the data set

### Who is Ronald Fisher? 
Ronal Aylemer Fisher was one of the greatest scientists of 20th centuary. He specialised in statistics and genetics. He contributed to the world of statistics by creating several methods of analysing the data, such as ANOVA, hypothesis testing and f distribution. He also published several books about statistical research methods, the theory of natural selection and origin of species. 

### What information data set contains?
The data set is from one of the research papers written by Fisher in 1936. In the computer science field it is known as "Iris Flower Data Set". It describes characteristics of iris flower.This data set consist of 150 samples (50 samples from each flower type) The data set contains 4 different attributes. These 4 attributes represent: sepal length, sepal witdh, petal length and petal width. Additionally the data contains of one more column which tells us the type of iris flower, there are 3 different types Setosa, Versicolour and Virginica.

### What is the purpose of this data set?
One could think that this data set is for biologist only. Several sources (Ritchieng and Technopedia) say that this data set is famous for machine learning, because it is easy to predict. It is an example of traditional resource which is widely used in computer science for testing purposes.

## Summary of the data set  
The summary of the data set shows the maximum, minimum and mean of each column of the data set.

## Summary of the project investigation
The main aim of this project is to analyse the dataset by using python programming language and writing a python code for it.

## Data Visualization
6. Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary.
